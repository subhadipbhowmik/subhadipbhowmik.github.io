OK. Now follow my steps to create a theme like this and publish it on the VS Code Marketplace.

### Requirements:

1. Node.js installed
2. Visual Studio Code

## Steps to Create Your First VS Code Extension:

### STEP 01: Install Yo Code
Open Command Prompt or Terminal and run the command below

`npm install -g yo generator-code`

It will install the all packages of Code Generator for VS Code globally in your machine.

Now run the code below:
`yo code`

### STEP 02: Choose Extension type

Now here you have to choose which type of extension you want to create. So as we are going to create a Theme Extension, follow the steps as below. Choose these options as described below.

1. New Color Theme
2. No, start fresh
3. Give a name of your extension i.e Codingo Theme
4. Keep the identifier name as default and hit enter
5. Add some description of your extension
6. Put a name of your theme, which will reflect to the users
7. Now select the base of the theme

**There will be 4 types of theme in VS Code editor**

Press enter to open the folder in Vs Code directly

Now there will be a lots of folders and files. No need to worry about it. We only need to know about two most important files.

1. package.json - manifest file for our extension
2. Codingo Theme-color-theme.json in themes folder - it contains all themes color properties of our theme.

Now open the **theme.json** file under **Themes folder**
Here you will see all the colors for different section of the VS Code Editor is defined. If you are not aware about Colors, no worry my friend. I am with you.

Now go to [VS Code Theme editor](https://themes.vscode.one/) and create an account here. You will find lots of eye catching VS Code theme just choose any of these, and download the theme file.

I have already created a theme for you for making it easier [click here](https://themes.vscode.one/theme/shubhadip_bhowmik/F2qfyreH) to fork my theme.

Now  go to **open the theme.json file and replace it's existing code with the code of newly downloaded code file**.

That's it. Your theme is ready. Now it's time to test your theme. To test your theme just use F5. A debugger will open. Create new files and you will see that the color of your VS Code has already change. 

Now all set. Congratulations! You made your own theme.

Now we are in the next phase. Yes you are right. We will publish the theme to VS Code marketplace so that everyone on the internet can install and use in to their computer.

Now open the VS Code and go to **package,json** file. Here you need to add some extra informations to publish the extensions. You have to add metadata like publisher, repositories, keywords update version code etc.

```
"publisher": "Your Publisher Id",
  "keywords": [

    "Editor Theme"
  ],
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",

Just copy and paste the code just after **description ** of your code. See the code below.

**Update Readme.md file** as per your wish.

### Create Extension Package
